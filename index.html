<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Due to the inherent ease of textual input for user engagement, it is natural to generate music from text. 
In this paper, we introduce MuseCoco (Music Composition Copilot), a system meticulously designed to compose symbolic music from text descriptions. It operates by utilizing musical attributes as a bridge and dividing the process into text-to-attribute understanding stage and attribute-to-music generation stage, which bestows three key advantages: 
First, it eliminates the need for paired text-to-music data, as text-attribute pairs for the text-to-attribute understanding stage can be automatically synthesized as many as needed, and attributes required for the attribute-to-music generation stage can be directly extracted from music data, thus alleviating the labor-intense process of human annotation. 
Second, thanks to the explicit attribute design, the system excels in offering precise control over musical attributes, which ensures a high degree of accuracy in shaping the musical output according to user's intentions.
Third, it can offer an additional attribute-conditioned control option beyond textual input, enhancing its versatility and usability.
Our experimental results demonstrate that MuseCoco significantly outperforms our top-performing baseline model, GPT-4, on musicality, controllability, and overall score, by 45.5%, 35.2%, and 47.0%, respectively. There is also a notable enhancement of approximately 20% in objective control accuracy. Additionally, we have developed a large-scale model with 1.2 billion parameters, showcasing exceptional controllability and musicality. 
In practical applications, MuseCoco can serve as a user-friendly tool for musicians, enabling them to effortlessly generate music by simply providing text descriptions, and offering a substantial enhancement in efficiency compared to manually composing music from scratch. </p>

<p><b>Please note:</b> this work focuses on generating symbolic music, which do not contain timbre information. 
    We use MuseScore (https://musescore.org/en) to export mp3 files for reference, musicians are encouraged to leverage the .mid files for further timbre improvement.</p>

        <p><b>Comments:</b></p>
        <p>BART-base: The generated sample from BART demonstrates inadequate control over attributes such as time signature, duration, and octaves. Furthermore, the sample's musicality suffers due to a lack of harmonies, resulting in an incomplete composition.</p>
        <p>GPT-4: The generated music from GPT-4 is controlled well. However, it tends to sound monotonous since the rhythm patterns lack of variations, which is common in most generated music from GPT-4. Furthermore, some counterpoints in the composition, specifically in the 4th and 10th bars, lack well-designed integration, detracting from the overall quality of the piece.</p>
        <p>MuseCoco: The generated music from MuseCoco is controlled precisely. Besides, it has more complex harmonies and more diverse rhythm patterns for a better listening experience.</p>

        <p>BART-base: The generated music deviates from the attributes specified in the text description, such as time signature, duration, and octaves. Furthermore, the style of the music does not resemble that of Chopin. Additionally, the abnormal usage of rests within each voice part raises doubts about the composition's coherence and musicality.</p>
        <p>GPT-4: The generated music falls short in multiple aspects. It does not span 4 octaves as specified, and it fails to capture the essence of Chopin's style. The melody lacks variation, resulting from limited rhythm patterns and harmonies. Additionally, the inclusion of two identical tracks introduces redundancy and detracts from the overall composition.</p>
        <p>MuseCoco: The generated music demonstrates precise control. Specifically, the 5th and 6th bars skillfully capture the distinct essence and emotive qualities associated with Chopin's style, effectively conveying the desired musical expression.</p>

    <p>Explanations: </p>
    <p>Those generated music samples exhibit the characteristics of typical popular music. Each sample lasts approximately 16 bars and has distinct tempos of 114 BPM, 102 BPM, and 108 BPM respectively. The melodies span approximately 4 octaves, contributing to the overall range of the piece. Throughout the composition, a major chord progression is employed, creating a consistent and uplifting atmosphere from start to finish. This tonal choice effectively captures the essence of a beautiful, bright day accompanied by a clear blue sky, evoking a sense of positivity and joy.</p>

<h2 id="musiclm">Comparison with MusicLM</h2>
<p>While MusicLM primarily focuses on generating musical audio from text descriptions, a distinct contrast to our work which involves generating symbolic music from similar textual cues, we find value in presenting comparative results with MusicLM. This allows us to effectively highlight the strengths and limitations of both approaches.</p>
<p>The samples of MusicLM are generated with this link: https://aitestkitchen.withgoogle.com/experiments/music-lm</p>

    <p><b>Conclusion:</b> The end-to-end methods encounter challenges: 1) They need lots of paired data, which is hard and costly to gather. 2) These methods compress control details into a single vector, making precise control tough. We tested controlling MusicLM (an end-to-end model) with our dataset and found it struggles with fine details like tempo and meter. Unlike end-to-end methods, our work emphasizes the composition process. It empowers users to finely control musical attributes during music creation, aligning with the iterative and expressive nature of composition. This dynamic collaboration between human creativity and AI assistance enriches the environment for music composition.</p>
